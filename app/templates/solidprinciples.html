        <h3>SOLID Principles</h3>
        <h4 class="adjust-margin">In Python</h4>
        <div class="page-section">
            <div class="grid-left">
                <p>SOLID is a mnemonic abbreviation for a set of design principles created for software development in
                    object-oriented languages. The principles in SOLID are intended to foster simpler, more robust and
                    updatable code from software developers. Each letter in SOLID corresponds to a principle for
                    development.</p>

                <p>The SOLID principles were defined in the early 2000s by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Uncle Bob
                    elaborated some of these and identified others already existing and said that these principles
                    should be
                    used to get good management of dependencies in our code.</p>

                <p>SOLID is a short form. It stands for:</p>
                <ul class="ul-python">
                    <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
                    <li>Open and Closed Principle</li>
                    <li>Lisvok Sub situation Principle</li>
                    <li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
                    <li>Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="adjust-margin-bottom">The most accurate description for SOLID principles comes from the Zen of
                    Python, by Tim Peters:</p>

                <h4>Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)</h4>
                <p class="adjust-margin">A class/module should have only one responsibility and therefore only one
                    reason to
                    change. That means a class does not perform multiple jobs.</p>
                <p>The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is all about increasing cohesion and decreasing coupling by
                    organizing code around responsibilities. It's not a big leap to see why that happens. If all the
                    code
                    for any given responsibility is in a single place that's cohesive and while responsibilities may be
                    similar they don't often overlap.</p>
                <p><span><b>Relevant Zen:</b></span> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do
                    things</p>
                <p><span><b>Real world example:</b></span> If it is your responsibility to sweep and my responsibility
                    to
                    mop there's no reason for me to keep track of whether or not the floor has been swept. I can just
                    ask
                    you, "has the floor been swept"? and base my action according to your response.</p>
                <p><span><b>Technical example with explanation:</b></span> In our below Calculator example, each class
                    has
                    its own single responsibility like the calculator class has a single responsibility of being the
                    outermost class that holds methods for all operations, like the ‘__add__’, ‘__sub__’, ‘__mul__’ and
                    ‘__truediv__’, each having a single responsibility of calling the respective operations’ classes,
                    such
                    as ‘Addition’, ‘Subtraction’, ‘Multiplication’ and ‘Division’ respectively. These classes in-turn
                    have a
                    single responsibility of performing their respective operations on a list of numbers. Similarly, the
                    class ‘CalculatorResult’ has a single responsibility of taking care of/ maintaining a list for the
                    results after the calculation/ operation is formed. It has methods such as the ‘clear_history()’,
                    which
                    has a single responsibility of clearing the list of results; the ‘count_history()’, which has a
                    single
                    responsibility of returning the length of the list of results; the ‘get_last_calculation_object()’,
                    which has a single responsibility of returning the latest result added to the list, so on and so
                    forth.
                </p>
                <p>If you notice, all the classes have relevant methods pertaining to changing the behavior of related
                    objects, which is also important for satisfying this principle.</p>

                <h4>Open Closed Principle (OCP)</h4>
                <p class="adjust-margin">Software Entities (classes, functions, modules) should be open for extension
                    but
                    closed to change.</p>
                <p><span><b>Relevant Zen:</b></span> Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.
                </p>
                <p>Since the definition of change and extension are so similar it is easy to get overwhelmed by the Open
                    Closed Principle. I've found the most intuitive way to decide if I'm making a change or extension is
                    to
                    think about function signatures. A change is anything that forces calling code to be updated. This
                    could
                    be changing the function name, swapping the order of parameters, or adding a non-default parameter.
                    Any
                    code that calls the function would be forced to change in accordance with the new signature. An
                    extension, on the other hand, allows for new functionality, without having to change the calling
                    code.
                    This could be renaming a parameter, adding a new parameter with a default value, or adding the *arg,
                    or
                    **kwargs parameters. Any code that calls the function would still work as originally written. The
                    same
                    rules apply to classes as well.</p>
                <p><span><b>Real world example:</b></span> In gardening, when you use single pots to plant a seed, it is
                    not
                    open for extension, meaning, you cannot add another plant’s seed in the same plant and you also
                    would
                    not be able to change once the seedling starts to grow. But on the other hand, if we plant seeds
                    along
                    the length of your garden in the ground, this would be open for extension, meaning, we could add ‘n’
                    number of different seeds.</p>
                <p><span><b>Technical example with explanation:</b></span> In the below example, as you can see there is
                    class ‘PandasFileReader’ which has a single responsibility of reading and extracting data from an
                    external file based on its file type using pandas (an open-source tool for data analysis in Python).
                    It
                    contains methods ‘read_file()‘ that read the file type and calls the respective methods based on the
                    file type, ‘_process_xlsx_file()’ that reads and extracts data from excel file and creates a data
                    frame
                    for that data and finally, ‘_process_csv_file()’ that reads and extracts data from csv file and
                    creates
                    a data frame for that data.
                    This class can be extended by adding methods that will read and extract data from other file types
                    like
                    text or tsv(tab separated file) etc. The ‘read_file()‘ method could also be extended by adding the
                    other
                    file types.
                    The methods of class cannot be modified, meaning the existing methods cannot be changed or in other
                    words there is no need to change it as the class is designed in a way that more methods can be added
                    easily.

                    implement that method unnecessarily and repeatedly and hence does not conform to ISP principle.
                    Thus,
                    the method is made a static method which gives freedom for the child class.</p>

                    low-level
                    modules. They should depend on abstractions and abstractions should not depend on details, rather
                    details should depend on abstractions.</p>

                <p><span><b>Real world example:</b></span> When you are reading the news, you can read from a lot of
                    different sources. So you are the reader are not either dependent on a particular form like
                    newspaper or
                    online or an app or on the source of news like news channels or social platforms. At the end of the

                    the
                    ‘Calculation’ class and the ‘Multiplication’ class. The parent class, ‘Calculation’ is not dependent
                    on
                    the child class, ‘Multiplication’ itself but rather it depends on the abstract implementation of the
                    ‘get_result()’ method. The parent class also is not dependent on how this method has been
                    implemented in
                    its child class(s).</p>
                <p>The child class follows abstraction by defining this method in its own unique way by expecting its
                    own
                    object and returning a final result.</p>

            <p class="t-align-center">SOLID isn't a perfect methodology and can lead to complex applications with many
                moving parts, and occasionally lead to writing code just in case it's needed. Using SOLID means writing
                more
                classes and creating more interfaces, but many modern IDE's will solve that problem through automated
                code
                completion.
                That said, it does force you to separate concerns, to think about inheritance, prevent repeating code
                and
                carefully approach writing applications. Thinking about how objects fit together in an application is,
                after
                all, what object-oriented code is all about.
